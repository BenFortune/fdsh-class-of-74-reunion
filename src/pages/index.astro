			<p>Believe it or not 2024 will mark the 50th year since we graduated from Fort Dodge Senior High. The Class of 74 Reunion Planning Committee would appreciate your help/attendance in celebrating this milestone. Part of the planning is knowing how many classmates will be able to attend. Please let one of the Committee Member classmates noted below, if you can, or cannot attend. (the “cannot attend confirms you received the message, and we did not overlook any classmate)</p>
